[Appllama](https://appllama.io) is the design library of top-grossing mobile
apps — their real screens, flows, and UI patterns, with revenue and download
context. These skills turn that library into an agent's working method:
study every screen of the apps that already win, extract the category's
design language, then build screens that hold up next to them.

## The skills

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`appllama-usage`](skills/appllama-usage/SKILL.md) | The research engine: how to use the [Appllama MCP](https://mcp.appllama.io/mcp) like a design director — the full tool map, and the playbooks for building an app from scratch, improving an existing screen, and flow & element research. |
| [`appllama-app-design-skill`](skills/appllama-app-design-skill/SKILL.md) | The build bar: native-feeling Expo / React Native screens — Apple HIG fidelity, semantic colors, native controls, anti-slop discipline, Reanimated motion, perceived performance, generated image assets, and a full-motion simulator-verified iteration loop (whole flows recorded and scrubbed at 60 fps, not screenshots). |

They are designed as a pair: **usage** decides what to study, **design**
decides how to build, and both insist the loop only ends in a simulator
with a screen you can't fault.

## Install

One command, from your project root — works with Claude Code, Cursor,
Codex, and [70+ other agents](https://skills.sh):

```bash
npx skills@latest add appllama/appllama-skills
```

Variations:

```bash
# install for specific agents, no prompts
npx skills@latest add appllama/appllama-skills -a claude-code -a cursor -y

# install user-wide instead of per-project
npx skills@latest add appllama/appllama-skills -g
```

### Only want the app design skill?

`appllama-app-design-skill` stands on its own — the native-quality build
bar, anti-slop discipline, and the full-motion simulator loop work with or
without the Appllama MCP connected:

```bash
npx skills@latest add appllama/appllama-skills --skill appllama-app-design-skill
```

(The same `--skill` flag installs only `appllama-usage` if you want just the
research engine.)

<details>
<summary>Manual install</summary>

Skills are plain directories — copy them into your agent's skills folder
(`.claude/skills/` per project, `~/.claude/skills/` user-wide, or your
harness's equivalent):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/appllama/appllama-skills
cp -r appllama-skills/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

</details>

## Connect the Appllama MCP

The skills assume the Appllama MCP is connected:

```
https://mcp.appllama.io/mcp
```

Add it as a custom connector in Claude, Cursor, Codex, or any MCP client
and approve the connection with your Appllama account. MCP access is part
of [Pro](https://appllama.io/pricing), credits reset in full on the 1st of each month. 
One tool call = one credit;
`get_credits` is always free.

## Try it

With the MCP connected and the skills installed, ask your agent:

> Build me a habit tracker. Study the top-grossing habit apps first and
> don't stop until every screen survives the simulator comparison.

> Make this screen better. *(paste a screenshot, code, or a "Copy Screen
> ID" ref from appllama.io)*

> How do the best fitness apps structure onboarding — how long, what does
> each step earn, and where does the paywall sit?
